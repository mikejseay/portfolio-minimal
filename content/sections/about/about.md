Trained as a computational neuroscientist, I've spent the past 11 years processing, storing, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets.

I was born and raised in New Orleans, where I attended Tulane University, receiving my BS and MS degrees in Neuroscience. There, I created my first data processing architectures to support analysis of complex neurobehavioral datasets.

In 2015, I moved to New York and joined a lab with far more data: tens of thousands of participants with neurobehavioral, genealogical, and genetic information. I co-engineered a database system to store, update, and access 100k+ records from disparate sources, and I wrote a module for analyzing and plotting EEG data. I utilized the tools I made to create visualizations supporting the lab's grants and publications.

From 2017 to 2022 I completed a Ph.D at UCLA, where I focused on creating computational models that could explain neural functions. Through my work, I gained foundational knowledge of statistics and machine learning from the neuroscientific perspective, and I continued refining my skills in handling large and complex datasets.

My intention for the next long-term chapter of my life is to bring my skills and knowledge to industry.
