I was born and raised in New Orleans, where I attended Tulane University, receiving my BS and MS degrees in Neuroscience. In 2010, I began creating my career as a scientist and programmer by building my first data processing architectures to support analysis of complex neurobehavioral datasets.

In 2015, I moved to New York and joined a lab with far more data: tens of thousands of participants with neurobehavioral, genealogical, and genetic information. I co-engineered a database system to store, update, and access 100k+ records from disparate sources, and I wrote a module for analyzing and plotting EEG data. I utilized the tools I made to create visualizations supporting the lab's grants and publications.

From 2017 to 2022 I completed a Ph.D at UCLA, where I focused on creating computational models that could explain neural functions. Through my work, I gained foundational knowledge of statistics and machine learning from the neuroscientific perspective, and I continued refining my skills in handling large and complex datasets.

In October of 2022, I accepted a position as a Data Scientist in the Precision Agriculture division at FMC. There, I help create predictive models that enable farmers to anticipate the pressure of pests, weeds, and diseases on their crops. This allows farmers to minimize the usage of pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides, which minimizes costs, environmental impacts, and the development of biological resistances.
